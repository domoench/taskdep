A task dependency graph visualization editor. Built with react and d3.

I came up with this while working on [blubox](https://blubox.house) because I kept creating dependency graphs to figure out what construction tasks depended on others. At the time I used [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) which was manual and cumbersome. This tool is an (in-progress) attempt to make a more interactive dependency graph visualization tool.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
