A task dependency graph visualization editor. Built with react and d3.

I came up with this while working on [blubox](https://blubox.house) because I kept creating dependency graphs to figure out what construction tasks depended on others. At the time I used [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) which was manual and cumbersome. This tool is an (in-progress) attempt to make a more interactive dependency graph visualization tool.

Demo of the current state: https://taskdep.netlify.com/

As of 12/26/2018 the core functionality is all implemented, but I haven't done any nice styling (it's ugly as sin).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
